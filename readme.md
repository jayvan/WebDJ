Web DJ
======

With Web DJ you and your friends can all create a shared playlist and listen to the songs in sync. Think of it as a radio station where you are the hosts. The music is streamed from publicly available sites such as Sound Cloud and Youtube.

Roadmap
=======

- Have the server only take in the provider and media_id, it should pull the info like duration, etc.
- Add Soundcloud
- Facebook/Google account integration
- Better UI
- Background worker to pull media info
